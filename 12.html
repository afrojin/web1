<h2>css 이란?</h2>

<strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss" target="_blank" title="css">css</a>is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.
<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and
render the documents into multimedia web pages. <br>HTML describes the structure of
a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. <br>With HTML constructs,
images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
rendered page. <br/>HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and
other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
<br>Tags such as and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and
provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

<p style="margin-top : 40px;">HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript,
which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines
the look and layout of content. <br>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer
of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
presentational HTML since 1997.</p>
